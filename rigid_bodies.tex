\section{Introduction}

Improvements in molecular dynamics (MD) algorithms, along with advances in software and hardware, have allowed researchers to extend both the time and length scales attainable in their atomistic simulations. This progress has fomented the ambitious attempt to elucidate complex physical phenomena such as the mechanisms underlying molecular motors, pathways for nanoparticle assembly, and interfacial phenomena, to name just a few. Because of its complexity and large computational demand, such a challenging task requires strategies to enlarge the achievable scales even further.

One of the strategies employed to speed up MD simulations is the suppression of unimportant degrees of freedom, as might be the case of intramolecular vibrations. Iterative methods such as SHAKE\cite{Ryckaert1977} and RATTLE\cite{Andersen1983} achieved this suppression by adding constraints to the equations of motion. This is the standard approach in the common case of molecular models with fixed bond lengths and bending angles, but flexible dihedral angles. However, for molecules modeled as rigid structures or those containing rigid substructures,\cite{Miller2002} the dynamics of rigid bodies emerges a suitable approach. It is expected to be computationally more efficient because the constraints are treated implicitly. In addition, and most importantly, it is possible to devise symplectic integrators for simulations in the microcanonical ensemble. Being symplectic implies phase-space volume preservation and time reversibility, which are sufficient conditions for numerical integrators to used in hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods.\cite{Duane1987} In this context, Miller \textit{et al}.\cite{Miller2002} have introduced a symplectic integrator for the rotational motion represented in terms of unit quaternions. This approach has been successfully used in pure MD as well as in HMC methods to simulate a wide variety of systems of rigid molecules, including liquid water,\cite{Sakamaki2011, Reinhardt2012, Palmer2014, Gonzales2014} ice,\cite{Geiger2014} hydrates,\cite{Tribello2009, Gorman2012} gases diffusing in metal-organic frameworks,\cite{Ghoufi2010} etc. It has also been applied for molecules designed as collections of interconnected rigid bodies, which is a coarse-graining strategy often used for proteins,\cite{Terada2003}, molecular machines,\cite{Akimov2008, Konyukhov2010} nanoparticles,\cite{Knorowski2012, Patra2013} etc.

In this paper, we present a simplified formulation for the motion of rigid bodies in the microcanonical (NVE) and canonical (NVT) ensembles, as well as corresponding numerical integrators. The contribution in the NVE case relies on a factorization of the rotation matrix that allows a Hamiltonian formalism without the need of extending the rotational phase space, thus simplifying the formulation of Miller \textit{et al}.\cite{Miller2002} In the NVT case, both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are simultaneously coupled to a unique Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat. This differs from the approach of Kamberaj \textit{et al}.,\cite{Kamberaj2005} in which two independent thermostat chains act separately on the rotational and the translational degrees of freedom. We have also simplified the calculation of pressure for systems with rigid bodies whose constituent atoms interact via a pairwise potential under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The expression we derive depends on the resultant interaction forces between body pairs. This avoids the evaluation of constraint forces, which are necessary if the pressure is calculated in terms of the interatomic forces.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:mechanics} we present a mathematical reformulation of the equations of motion of rigid bodies using a Hamiltonian formalism. In Sec.~\ref{sec:moleculardynamics} we devise numerical integrators for both the NVE and NVT ensembles, whose correctness we discuss in terms of conserved quantities. Additionally, for the NVE case we present some results related to kinetic energy partition and, for the NVT case, we also analyze the statistical distributions of the sampled energy. After that, in Sec.~\ref{sec:pressure} we present the equation developed for the pressure.

Note that, throughout this paper, we employ the word ``quaternion'' as a synonym for a four-dimensional vector and avoid other interpretations. Only ordinary matrix/vector operations are present in the formulation. Some mathematical details are given in the Appendix.

\section{Mechanics of Rigid Body Motion}
\label{sec:mechanics}

In this section, we first review certain aspects of the kinematics of rigid bodies which are relevant to the present study. Unity quaternions are employed to represent the orientations of rigid bodies. Then, we introduce the use of a particular factorization of the rotation matrix, from which a mathematical relation arises between the rate of change of a four-dimensional quaternion and a three-dimensional angular velocity vector. An important feature of this relation is that it preserves the unit-norm constraint of the quaternion upon infinitesimal motion.

\subsection{Kinematics}
\label{sec:kinematics}

Consider a rigid body composed of $n_p$ individual particles, with each particle $j$ having mass $M_j$ and being located at a Cartesian coordinate $\vt R_j$. The center of mass of this body is located at
\[
\vt r = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n_p} M_j {\vt R}_j,
\]
where $m = \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} M_j$ is the total mass of the body. The position of each particle $j$ in a space-fixed frame of reference, whose origin coincides with the body's center of mass, is ${\vt \delta}_j = \tr{ [\begin{array}{ccc} {\delta_j}_x & {\delta_j}_y & {\delta_j}_z \end{array}]} = {\vt R}_j - {\vt r}$. In such frame, the symmetric inertia tensor for rotations of the body about the origin is\cite{Goldstein2002}
\[
{\mt I}^\ast = \sum_{j=1}^N M_j \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
{\delta_j}_y^2 + {\delta_j}_z^2 & -{\delta_j}_x {\delta_j}_y & -{\delta_j}_x {\delta_j}_z \\
-{\delta_j}_y {\delta_j}_x & {\delta_j}_x^2 + {\delta_j}_z^2 & -{\delta_j}_y {\delta_j}_z \\
-{\delta_j}_z {\delta_j}_x & -{\delta_j}_z {\delta_j}_y & {\delta_j}_x^2 + {\delta_j}_y^2 \\
\end{array} \right].
\]

For every non-collinear rigid body, there exists a particular frame of reference in which its inertia tensor is diagonal. The corresponding axes are known as the principal axes and the formulation of the equations of motion in this frame of reference is notably simplified. Conversions from the space-fixed frame to such a body-fixed frame are performed by a rotation matrix $\mt A$ that satisfies the similarity relation\citep{Goldstein2002}
\[
{\mt I} = {\mt A} {\mt I}^\ast \tr{\mt A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
I_1 &   0 &   0 \\
  0 & I_2 &   0 \\
  0 &   0 & I_3 \\
\end{array} \right],
\]
where $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ (the principal moments of inertia) are the eigenvalues of ${\mt I}^\ast$ and the columns of $\tr{\mt A}$ (the principal axes of rotation) are their corresponding eigenvectors. Algorithms for calculating $\mt A$ from $\mt I^\ast$ can be found, for example, in Ref.~\onlinecite{Kopp2008}. Once this is done, the position of every particle $j$ in the body-fixed frame can be obtained by ${\vt d}_j = {\mt A} {\vt \delta}_j$. Since $\mt A$ represents an orthogonal transformation, a conversion in the opposite direction is done by ${\vt \delta}_j = \tr{\mt A} {\vt d}_j$.\cite{Goldstein2002} This is so because $\mt A \tr{\mt A} = \mt 1_3$, where $\mt 1_k$ represents an identity matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$ . By differentiating both sides of this relation with respect to time, we conclude that ${\mt A} \tr{\dot{\mt A}} = -\dot{\mt A} \tr{\mt A}$, which means that $\mt A \tr{\dot{\mt A}}$ results in a skew-symmetric matrix. This product is related to $\vt \omega$, the angular velocity of the body in the body-fixed frame, by\cite{Haug1989}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relation_A_omega}
\mt S(\vt \omega) = \mt A \tr{\dot{\mt A}} = -\dot{\mt A} \tr{\mt A},
\end{equation}
where $\mt S(\cdot)$ is the skew-symmetric operator defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:operator_S}.

\subsection{The Rate of Change of Unit Quaternions}
\label{sec:eulerparameters}

Euler's rotation theorem establishes that an arbitrary rotation can be described using three independent parameters. One can use, for instance, the so-called Euler angles, but mathematical singularities arise when the equations of motion are described in such terms. Instead, we consider an alternative representation, in which the orientation of a rigid body is given by the Euler parameters $q_0$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$, which form a quaternion $\vt q = \tr {[\begin{array}{cccc} q_0 & q_1 & q_2 & q_3 \end{array}]}$. The mathematical relation between the Euler angles and the Euler parameters requires that\cite{Goldstein2002}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:norm_eq_1}
\tr{\vt q}{\vt q} = \|\vt q\|^2 = q_0^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 = 1.
\end{equation}

Therefore, $\vt q$ is restricted to the surface of a unit hypersphere in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is itself a three-dimensional domain. Appendix~\ref{sec:quat_from_A} describes how one can compute the unit quaternion related to a given rotation matrix. Reversely, the matrix $\mt A$ can be directly computed from a given unit quaternion $\vt q$ by\cite{Allen1989,Miller2002}
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A_from_q}
\mt A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
q_0^2 + q_1^2 - q_2^2 - q_3^2 & 2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & 2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) \\
2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 + q_2^2 - q_3^2 & 2(q_2 q_3 + q_0 q_1) \\
2(q_1 q_3 + q_0 q_2) & 2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 - q_2^2 + q_3^2  
\end{array} \right].
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}

The rate of change of a quaternion is denoted by $\dot{\vt q}$. Differentiating Eq.~\ref{eq:norm_eq_1} with respect to time yields
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_qTq}
\tr{\vt q}\dot{\vt q} = 0,
\end{equation}
which implies that, for Eq.~\ref{eq:norm_eq_1} to be preserved upon an infinitesimal motion, $\dot{\vt q}$ must lie in the hyperplane orthogonal to $\vt q$.

Let us now introduce two new matrices that also depend on the Euler parameters, which are
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:def_B_and_C}
\begin{align}
\mt B &= \left[
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-q_1 & -q_2 & -q_3 \\
 q_0 & -q_3 &  q_2 \\
 q_3 &  q_0 & -q_1 \\
-q_2 &  q_1 &  q_0
\end{array}
\right] \text{ and} \label{eq:def_B} \\
\mt C &= \left[
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-q_1 & -q_2 & -q_3 \\
 q_0 &  q_3 & -q_2 \\
-q_3 &  q_0 &  q_1 \\
 q_2 & -q_1 &  q_0
\end{array}
\right].
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Some important properties of these matrices (or transposes thereof) have been reported in the literature\cite{Haug1989, Shuster1993, Dichmann1999, Ravishankar2004, Nielsen2012} and are revisited with our particular notation in Appendix~\ref{sec:auxiliary_math}. The most remarkable feature is that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:factorization_of_A}
{\mt A} = \tr{\mt B}{\mt C}.
\end{equation}

The equation above is a simple and convenient factorization of matrix $\mt A$, since the entries of both $\mt B$ and $\mt C$ depend linearly on the Euler parameters. As demonstrated in Appendix~\ref{sec:auxiliary_math}, this factorization provides a relation between the angular velocity vector $\vt \omega$ and the rates of change of the Euler parameters. Such relation is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relation_qdot_omega}
\dot{\vt q} = \frac{1}{2} \mt B \vt \omega.
\end{equation}

As explained in the appendix, premultiplication with either $\mt B$ or $\mt C$ transforms a vector into a quaternion that lies in the hyperplane orthogonal to $\vt q$. Therefore, the equation above satisfies Eq.~\ref{eq:diff_qTq} identically and guarantees that the norm of $\vt q$ remains unchanged. Both transformations can be reversed by applying $\tr{\vt B}$ or $\tr{\vt C}$ accordingly.

\subsection{Hamiltonian Dynamics}
\label{sec:hamiltonian}

The relation between $\vt q$ and $\vt \omega$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:relation_qdot_omega}) obtained in the previous subsection is used here to develop a Hamiltonian formalism for the motion of rigid body. As usual, it can be described by detaching translation and rotation, represented by ${\vt r}(t)$ and ${\vt q}(t)$, respectively. The position of each particle $j$ will vary with time as $\vt r_j(t) = \vt r(t) + \tr{[{\mt A}(\vt q(t))]}\vt d_j$. Several authors have obtained Hamiltonian equations for the rotation of rigid bodies using quaternions as generalized coordinates.\cite{Maciejewski1985, Dichmann1996, Miller2002, Ravishankar2004, Nielsen2012} Here we try to combine convenient features of their formulations.

We start by defining the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = K - U$ as a function of $\vt r$, $\dot{\vt r}$, $\vt q$, and $\dot{\vt q}$, where $K$ and $U$ are the kinetic and potential energies of the body, respectively. Since $K = \frac{1}{2} m \tr{\dot{\vt r}} \dot{\vt r} + \frac{1}{2} \tr{\vt \omega} \mt I \vt \omega$,\cite{Goldstein2002} we can resort to Eq.~\ref{eq:relation_qdot_omega} to write
\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m \tr{\dot{\vt r}} \dot{\vt r} + 2 \tr{\dot{\vt q}} \mt B \mt I \tr{\mt B} \dot{\vt q} - U(\vt r, \vt q).
\]

To employ the Hamiltonian approach, besides the linear momentum $\vt p = \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \dot{\vt r} = m \dot{\vt r}$, conjugated to $\vt r$, we introduce the quaternion momentum $\vt \pi = \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \dot{\vt q}$, conjugated to $\vt q$.\citep{Goldstein2002} By performing the differentiation (see Appendix \ref{sec:Diff_Rules}), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conj_momentum}
\vt \pi = 4 \mt B \mt I \tr{\mt B} \dot{\vt q} = 2 \mt B \mt I \vt \omega.
\end{equation}

Hence, the conjugated momentum $\vt \pi$ is also orthogonal to $\vt q$ (premultiplication of $\mt I \vt \omega$ by $\mt B$). Using the relation above, we can write down the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H} = K + U$ as a function of $\vt r$, $\vt p$, $\vt q$, and $\vt \pi$, which is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_with_B}
\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2m} \tr{\vt p} \vt p + \frac{1}{8} \tr{\vt \pi} {\mt B} {\mt I}^{-1} \tr{\mt B} \vt \pi + U(\vt r, \vt q).
\end{equation}

The equations of motion are obtained from the Hamiltonian by $\dot{\vt r} = \partial \mathcal{H} / \partial \vt p$, $\dot{\vt p} = -\partial \mathcal{H} / \partial \vt r$, $\dot{\vt q} = \partial \mathcal{H} / \partial \vt \pi$, and $\dot{\vt \pi} = -\partial \mathcal{H} / \partial \vt q$.\cite{Goldstein2002} Eq.~\ref{eq:H_with_B} is convenient for differentiation with respect to $\vt \pi$, since $\mt B$ depends on $\vt q$ only. However, if we define
\[
\mt \Omega = \left[
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-\pi_1 & -\pi_2 & -\pi_3 \\
 \pi_0 & -\pi_3 &  \pi_2 \\
 \pi_3 &  \pi_0 & -\pi_1 \\
-\pi_2 &  \pi_1 &  \pi_0
\end{array}
\right],
\]
it follows that $\tr{\mt B}{\vt \pi} = \tr{\mt \Omega}{\vt q}$ and, therefore, a convenient form of $\mathcal{H}$ for differentiation with respect to $\vt q$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_with_Omega}
\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2m} \tr{\vt p} \vt p + \frac{1}{8} \tr{\vt q} {\mt \Omega} {\mt I}^{-1} \tr{\mt \Omega} \vt q + U(\vt r, \vt q).
\end{equation}

For a rigid body composed of $n_p$ individual particles, the derivative $\partial U/\partial \vt r$ is obtained by
\[
\diff{U}{\vt r} = -\vt F = -\sum_{j=1}^{n_p} {\vt F_j},
\]
where $\vt F_j$ is the force applied on particle $j$, expressed in the space-fixed frame of reference (see Appendix \ref{sec:Diff_PotEng}), and thus $\vt F$ is the resultant force on the body. To obtain the derivative $\partial U/\partial \vt q$, one must take into account that the entries of $\vt q$ are not independent, due to the constraint imposed by Eq.~\ref{eq:norm_eq_1}. The correct way of performing differentiation with respect to a constrained vector is described in Ref.~\onlinecite{Schay1995}. As demonstrated in Appendix \ref{sec:Diff_PotEng}, we have
\[
\diff{U}{\vt q} = -2 \mt C \vt \tau = -2 \mt C \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} {\vt \delta_j} \times {\vt F_j},
\]
where $\vt \tau$ is the resultant torque exerted on the body, also expressed in the space-fixed reference frame. Note that the product $\mt C \vt \tau$ results in a quaternion orthogonal to $\vt q$.

Finally, after carrying out the required differentiations of $\mathcal{H}$ using either Eq.~\ref{eq:H_with_B} or Eq.~\ref{eq:H_with_Omega} (see Appendix~\ref{sec:Diff_Rules}) and substituting $\vt \omega = \frac{1}{2} {\mt I}^{-1} \tr{\mt B} \vt \pi = \frac{1}{2} {\mt I}^{-1} \tr{\mt \Omega} \vt q$, we obtain the following Hamiltonian system of equations of motion for a rigid body:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:EDO_system}
\begin{align}
&\dot{\vt r} = \frac{1}{m} \vt p \\
&\dot{\vt p} = \mt F \\
&\dot{\vt q} = \frac{1}{2} \mt B \vt \omega \\
&\dot{\vt \pi} = \frac{1}{2} \mt \Omega \vt \omega + 2 \mt C \vt \tau
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Anticipating a feature that will be convenient in the forthcoming sections, we now consider the entries of $\vt \omega$ individually. Given that $2{\mt I}{\vt \omega} = \tr{\mt B}{\vt \pi}$, according to Eq.~\ref{eq:vector_entries}, each entry of $\vt \omega$ is obtained by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:omega_entry}
\omega_k = \frac{\tr{\vt \pi} \hat{\mt B}_k \vt q}{2 I_k},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mt B}_k$ is one of the permutation matrices presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:auxiliary_math}. In this context, the Hamiltonian of the rigid body becomes
\[
\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2m} \tr{\vt p} \vt p + U(\vt r, \vt q) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^3 I_k \omega_k^2.
\]

In order to rewrite Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system}, we open the products $\mt B \vt \omega$ and $\mt \Omega \vt \omega$ as in Eq.~\ref{eq:product_B_vector}, which leads us to a new form for the equations of motion:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:EDO_system_alternative}
\begin{align}
&\dot{\vt r} = \frac{1}{m} \vt p \\
&\dot{\vt p} = \vt F \\
&\dot{\vt q} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^3 \omega_k \hat{\mt B}_k \vt q \label{eq:edo_q} \\
&\dot{\vt \pi} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^3 \omega_k \hat{\mt B}_k \vt \pi + 2 \mt C \vt \tau \label{eq:edo_pi}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Symplectic Numerical Integration}  
\label{sec:symplectic}

An exact solution of Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system_alternative} would be symplectic in the phase space determined by $\vt r$, $\vt p$, $\vt q$, and $\vt \pi$. Hence, the described dynamics would be time-reversible and preserve both the Hamiltonian and the phase-space volume element. However, no closed-form solution is known, even in the simplest case of free motion (i.e., when $U$ is constant), due to the dependence of $\omega_k$ with $\vt q$ and $\vt \pi$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:omega_entry}) and the consequent coupling of Eqs.~\ref{eq:edo_q} and \ref{eq:edo_pi}. Nevertheless, it is possible to derive a symplectic approximate solution by applying the Liouville operator formalism.\cite{Tuckerman2010}

For a given trajectory in phase space, any function $f(\vt r, \vt p, \vt q, \vt \pi)$ will vary with time according to
\[
\dot{f} = \left( \tr{\dot{\vt r}} \diff{}{\vt r} + \tr{\dot{\vt p}} \diff{}{\vt p} + \tr{\dot{\vt q}} \diff{}{\vt q} + \tr{\dot{\vt \pi}} \diff{}{\vt \pi} \right) f = i\!L f,
\]
where $i\!L$ is the Liouville operator. This equation has a formal solution expressed by $f(t) = e^{t i\!L}f_0$, where $f_0$ is the initial value of $f$. As $f$ can be a phase-space coordinate, the exponential operator $e^{t i\!L}$, known as the classical time-evolution propagator,\cite{Tuckerman2008} represents a transformation from the initial condition to the phase-space point occupied at time $t$. Nevertheless, as no analytical solution is known for Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system_alternative}, the actual effect of its corresponding propagator cannot be determined.

Analytical solutions exist for some simpler hypothetical cases related to Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system_alternative}. Let us analyze three of them, which will be useful later on to derive a complete approximate solution. In what follows, an index $0$ stands for ``initial value''. We start by considering a hypothetical Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_t = (1/2m) \tr{\vt p} \vt p$, whose resulting equations of motion are $\dot{\vt r} = {\vt p}/m$, $\dot{\vt p} = 0$, $\dot{\vt q} = 0$, and $\dot{\vt \pi} = 0$. The exact solution for this case is
\begin{align*}
&{\vt r}(t) = {\vt r}_0 + \frac{t}{m} {\vt p}_0 \\
&{\vt p}(t) = {\vt p}_0 \\
&{\vt q}(t) = {\vt q}_0 \\
&{\vt \pi}(t) = {\vt \pi}_0
\end{align*}

This corresponds to a free translation (hence the subscript $t$). As the momentum $\vt p$ remains constant, the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_t$ is conserved, as expected. Of course, the solution above is the exact effect of the propagator $e^{t i\!L_t}$, where the Liouville operator $i\!L_t$ is, simply,
\[
i L_t = \frac{\tr{\vt p}}{m}\diff{}{\vt r}.
\]

In the second hypothetical case, referred to as the boost case, we consider a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_b = U(\vt r, \vt q)$. The resulting equations of motion are $\dot{\vt r} = 0$, $\dot{\vt p} = \vt F$, $\dot{\vt q} = 0$, and $\dot{\vt \pi} = 2 \mt C \vt \tau$, whose exact solution is
\begin{align*}
&{\vt r}(t) = {\vt r}_0 \\
&{\vt p}(t) = {\vt p}_0 + t \vt F_0 \\
&{\vt q}(t) = {\vt q}_0 \\
&{\vt \pi}(t) = {\vt \pi}_0 +  2 t \mt C_0 \vt \tau_0
\end{align*}

Note that $\vt r$ and $\vt q$ remain unaltered, thus keeping $\vt F$, $\mt C$, and $\vt \tau$ constant as well, which justifies the subscript $0$ assigned to them. This solution clearly conserves $\mathcal{H}_b$ and marks the effect of a propagator $e^{t i\!L_b}$, obtained from the operator
\[
i\!L_b = \tr{\vt F} \diff{}{\vt p} + 2 \tr{\vt \tau} \tr{\mt C} \diff{}{\vt \pi}.
\]

Finally, the third hypothetical case consists of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_k = (1/2) I_k \omega_k^2$. Note that a single entry of $\vt \omega$ is accounted for in this case, so that it corresponds to a free uniaxial rotation. The equations of motion resulting from $\mathcal{H}_k$ are $\dot{\vt r} = 0$, $\dot{\vt p} = 0$, $\dot{\vt q} = \frac{1}{2} \omega_k \hat{\mt B}_k \vt q$, and $\dot{\vt \pi} = \frac{1}{2} \omega_k \hat{\mt B}_k \vt \pi$. A special feature of this system facilitates its solution. It is known beforehand that the solution will keep $\mathcal{H}_k$ unaltered and, as a consequence, $\omega_k$ will be a constant as well. As noticed by Miller~\textit{el al.}~\cite{Miller2002}, this decouples the equations for $\dot{\vt q}$ and $\dot{\vt \pi}$, which are identical in form. The following analytical solution then takes place:\cite{Miller2002}
\begin{align*}
&{\vt r}(t) = {\vt r}_0 \\
&{\vt p}(t) = {\vt p}_0 \\
&{\vt q}(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\omega_k t}{2}\right) \vt q_0 + \sin\left(\frac{\omega_k t}{2}\right) \hat{\mt B}_k \vt q_0 \\
&{\vt \pi}(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\omega_k t}{2}\right) \vt \pi_0 + \sin\left(\frac{\omega_k t}{2}\right) \hat{\mt B}_k \vt \pi_0
\end{align*}

These equations, with $\omega_k$ calculated from $\vt q_0$ and $\vt \pi_0$ using Eq.~\ref{eq:omega_entry}, represent the effect of a propagator $e^{t i\!L_k}$ derived from the operator
\[
i\!L_k = \frac{1}{2} \omega_k \left( \tr{\vt q}\tr{\hat{\mt B}_k} \diff{}{\vt q} + \tr{\vt \pi}\tr{\hat{\mt B}_k} \diff{}{\vt \pi} \right).
\]

Now note that the Liouville operator corresponding to the original case of Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system_alternative} can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:full_operator}
i\!L = i\!L_t + i\!L_b + \sum_{k=1}^3 i\!L_k.
\end{align}

The Trotter-Suzuki splitting formula\cite{Trotter1959, Suzuki1976} can be used to devise a numerical solution for the rigid body motion, which still preserves the symplectic structure of Eq.~\ref{eq:EDO_system_alternative}. For a sum of two operators $i\!L_A$ and $i\!L_B$, such formula is
\[
e^{t(i\!L_A + i\!L_B)} \approx \left( e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_B} e^{\Delta t i\!L_A} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_B} \right)^\mathcal{N} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2),
\]
where $\Delta t = t/\mathcal N$ is the time step size and $\mathcal N$ is the number of steps. We recall that each exponential operator above will act having as initial condition the result of the operator at its right-hand side. Splitting schemes with higher-order approximations have been used for rigid body dynamics,\cite{Omelyan2007, Omelyan2008, vanZon2008} but they result in methods which are more complex and often require expensive force-gradient calculations. Moreover, it is unclear whether their benefits would extend to non-Hamiltonian numerical integrators, as required for molecular dynamics in ensembles other than NVE.

By defining $i\!L_r = \sum_{k=1}^3 i\!L_k$ as the Liouville operator for a complete free rotation and realizing that the operators $i\!L_r$ and $i\!L_t$ commute, the factorization we employ here for the Liouville operator in Eq.~\ref{eq:full_operator} is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:trotter_splitting_NVE}
e^{\Delta t i\!L} = e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b} e^{\Delta t i\!L_r} e^{\Delta t i\!L_t} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b}.
\end{equation}

Update of forces and torques is required only after the free translation and free rotation have been carried out. Each complete rotation is split as\cite{Miller2002}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:splitting_rot}
e^{\Delta t i\!L_r} = \prod_{j=1}^n \left( e^{\frac{\delta t_j}{2} i\!L_3} e^{\frac{\delta t_j}{2} i\!L_2} e^{\delta t_j i\!L_1} e^{\frac{\delta t_j}{2} i\!L_2} e^{\frac{\delta t_j}{2} i\!L_3} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\sum_{j=1}^n {\delta t}_j = \Delta t$. This means that free rotation, which is computationally inexpensive for not involving force calculations, can be carried out with a smaller time step for accuracy improvement. Following Ref.~\onlinecite{Miller2002}, one could simply make $\delta t_j = \Delta t/n$ for all $j$. Alternatively, one could use a higher-order factorization scheme, such as the one due to Yoshida\cite{Yoshida1990} and Suzuki,\cite{Suzuki1991a, Suzuki1991b} in which $\delta t_j = \omega_j \Delta t$ and the weights $\omega_j$ are carefully chosen to determine the order of approximation. It is our intention in this paper to investigate how the performance of the integrator as a whole is affected by using such a higher-order scheme. For that, we will consider $n = 1$ with $\omega_1 = 1$ (zero-order) and $n = 7$ with $\omega_1 = \omega_7 = 0.784513610477560$, $\omega_2 = \omega_6 = 0.235573213359357$, $\omega_3 = \omega_5 = -1.17767998417887$, and $\omega_4 = 1 - \sum_{j \neq 4} \omega_j$ (sixth-order).

\section{Molecular Dynamics}
\label{sec:molecular_dynamics}

In this section, we present factorization schemes for generating molecular dynamics algorithms in the microcanonical (NVE) and canonical (NVT) ensembles. In both cases, a three-dimensional system is considered as consisting of $N$ interacting, non-collinear rigid bodies occupying a fixed volume $V$. An index $i$ ranging from $1$ to $N$ indicates the quantities related to each body, including its generalized coordinates ($\vt r_i$ and $\vt q_i$) and conjugate momenta ($\vt p_i$ and $\vt \pi_i$). Thus, the phase space of the whole system now contains $3N$ spatial coordinates and $4N$ quaternion components, along with their conjugate momenta. Of course, $2N$ implicit constraints are known to exist, as $\tr{\vt q}_i{\vt q}_i = 1$ and $\tr{\vt q}_i{\vt \pi}_i = 0$ for all $i$.

\subsection{Microcanonical Ensemble}

Considering the system described above, with $\vt r^N$ and $\vt q^N$ representing the combined sets of all coordinates and quaternion components, we define the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_NVE}
\mathcal{H} = U(\vt r^N,\vt q^N) + \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac{\tr{\vt p}_i{\vt p}_i}{2m_i} + \frac{\tr{\vt \pi}_i {\mt B}_i {\mt I}_i^{-1} \tr{\mt B}_i {\vt \pi}_i}{8}\right).
\end{equation}

As usual, sampling of a microcanonical ensemble can be carried out by a Hamiltonian dynamics in phase space, which will have $\mathcal{H} = E$ as an integral of motion. The dynamics of this system is governed by a Liouville operator expressed as in Eq.~\ref{eq:full_operator}, but now with individual operators defined as
\[
\begin{split}
i\!L_b &= \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \tr{\vt F}_i \diff{}{\vt p_i} + 2 \tr{\vt \tau}_i \tr{\mt C}_i \diff{}{\vt \pi_i} \right), \\
i\!L_t &= \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\tr{\vt p}_i}{m_i}\diff{}{\vt r_i}, \quad \text{and} \\
i\!L_k &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N {\omega_i}_k \left( \tr{\vt q}_i\tr{\hat{\mt B}_k} \diff{}{\vt q_i} + \tr{\vt \pi_i}\tr{\hat{\mt B}_k} \diff{}{\vt \pi_i} \right).
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, a symplectic integrator can be devised using the same splitting scheme as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:symplectic}. The only difference is that the action of each propagator (boost, free translation, and free uniaxial rotation) must now occur simultaneously for all rigid bodies in the system. If there are no external forces acting on the bodies, then additional conserved quantities are the total linear momentum $\sum_{i=1}^N \vt p_i = \vt P$ and the generator of infinitesimal Galilean boosts\cite{Ray1999, Schwichtenberg2015} $\sum_{i=1}^N(\vt p_i t - m_i \vt r_i) = \boldsymbol{\mathcal G}$. If periodic boundary conditions are employed, as it is usual in molecular dynamics simulations, then there is no rotational symmetry and, consequently, no conservation of the total angular momentum.

\subsection{Canonical Ensemble}
\label{sec:canonical}

Kamberaj \textit{et al.}\cite{Kamberaj2005} proposed equations of motion and integration schemes for molecular dynamics with rigid bodies in the canonical ensemble...........

Knowledge on the dynamics and statistical mechanics of non-Hamiltonian systems has grown considerably in recent years.\cite{Tuckerman_1999, Tuckerman2001, Sergi2001, Sergi2003, Ezra2004, Sergi2004, Ezra2006, Sergi2010b} In this context, invaluable tools have been devised for the analysis and development of simulation methods based on the concept of extended phase space. Sergi and Ferrario\cite{Sergi2001} described a simple way of systematically generating conservative trajectories in an arbitrary phase space. If vector $\vt x$ represents a phase-space point, $H(\vt x)$ is a scalar field, and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal B}(\vt x)$ is a matrix-valued function, then the equation of motion
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eq_of_motion}
\dot{\vt x} = \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}\diff{H}{\vt x}
\end{equation}
will generate a flow that conserves the value of $H$, provided that $\boldsymbol{\mathcal B}$ is skew-symmetric, that is, $\tr{ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal B }} = -\boldsymbol{ \mathcal B }$. We employ such technique to couple a unique Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain\cite{Martyna1992} with $M$ thermostats to a system with $N$ rigid bodies. For this, we consider additional generalized coordinates $\eta_j$ and their conjugate momenta $p_{\eta_j}$, for $j$ ranging from $1$ to $M$. The conserved ``extended Hamiltonian'' in this case is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:H_nvt}
H = \mathcal{H} + \sum_{j=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\eta_j}^2}{2Q_j} + L k_bT\eta_1 + k_bT\sum_{j=2}^M \eta_j,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal H$ is the same as in Eq.~\ref{eq:H_NVE} and $L$ is a constant to be determined. The equations of motion regarding generalized coordinates are identical to those of a Hamiltonian system, i.e. $\dot{\vt r}_i = {\partial H}/{\partial \vt p_i}$ and $\dot{\vt q}_i = {\partial H}/{\partial \vt \pi_i}$ for every particle $i$ and $\dot{\eta}_j = {\partial H}/{\partial {p_\eta}_j}$ for every thermostat $j$. However, the equations of motion for generalized momenta contain non-Hamiltonian terms. For instance, the first thermostat of the chain acts on the translational and rotational momenta of each particle $i$ as
\[
\begin{split}
\dot{\vt p}_i &= -\diff{H}{\vt r_i} - {\vt p}_i \diff{H}{p_{\eta_1}} \quad \text{and} \\
\dot{\vt \pi}_i &= -\diff{H}{\vt q_i} - {\vt \pi}_i \diff{H}{p_{\eta_1}}.
\end{split}
\]

In the right-hand side of each equation above, the first term fulfills the skew-symmetry condition with respect to the corresponding coordinate while the second term enacts the coupling with the first thermostat. In turn, the equation of motion for $p_{\eta_1}$ must contain terms to ensure skew-symmetry with respect to the equations already shown, plus a term regarding the action of a second thermostat. The result is
\[
{\dot p}_{\eta_1} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \tr{\vt p_i} \diff{H}{\vt p_i} + \tr{\vt \pi_i} \diff{H}{\vt \pi_i}\right) - \diff{H}{\eta_1} - p_{\eta_1} \diff{H}{p_{\eta_2}}.
\]

Each additional thermostat will then act on the preceding one, and be acted upon by the succeeding one. Therefore, for $j$ from $2$ to $M-1$, the equations of motion are
\[
{\dot p}_{\eta_j} = -\diff{H}{\eta_j} + p_{\eta_{j-1}} \diff{H}{p_{\eta_{j-1}}} - p_{\eta_j} \diff{H}{p_{\eta_{j+1}}}.
\]

Finally, as the last thermostat will just act on the penultimate one, its equation of motion can be obtained by simply replacing $j = M$ and removing the last term in the equation above. Therefore, if we take all the required derivatives (including those described in Sec.~\ref{sec:hamiltonian}), the equations of motion for a system of rigid bodies coupled to a single Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain become
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:nhc_system}
\begin{align}
&\dot{\vt r}_i = \frac{{\vt p}_i}{m_i} \\ 
&\dot{\vt p}_i = {\vt F}_i - \alpha_1 \vt p_i \\
&\dot{\vt q}_i = \frac{1}{2} \mt B_i \vt \omega_i \label{eq:nhc_q} \\
&\dot{\vt \pi}_i = \frac{1}{2} \mt \Omega_i \vt \omega_i + 2 \mt C_i \vt \tau_i - \alpha_1 \vt \pi_i \label{eq:nhc_pi} \\
&\dot{\eta}_j = \alpha_j \\
&{\dot p}_{\eta_j} = G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In the equations above, ${\vt \omega}_i = \frac{1}{2} {\mt I}_i^{-1} \tr{\mt B}_i {\vt \pi}_i$, $\alpha_j = {p_{\eta_j}}/{Q_j}$ for $j \leq M$ and $\alpha_{M+1} = 0$, while
\begin{align*}
&G_1 = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{\tr{\vt p}_i{\vt p}_i}{m_i} + \tr{\vt \omega}_i \mt I_i \vt \omega_i \right) - L k_B T \quad \text{and}\\
&G_j = \frac{p_{\eta_{j-1}}^2}{Q_{j-1}} - k_b T \qquad \text{for} \; j > 1.
\end{align*}

As recommended in Ref.~\onlinecite{Martyna1992}, the inertial parameters can be calculated from a characteristic time scale $t_d$ of the system by $Q_1 = L k_B T t_d^2$ and, for $j > 1$, $Q_j = k_B T t_d^2$. Analysis of the probability distribution generated by the equations of motion in Eq.~\ref{eq:nhc_system} can be done via the generalized phase-space analysis of Tuckerman and coworkers.\cite{Tuckerman2001} For this, conservation laws must be identified and driven variables must be eliminated. For a system without external forces, the extended energy $H$ and the vector quantity $e^{\eta_1}\sum_{i=1}^N {\vt p}_i$ are integrals of motion, while the center-of-mass position can be considered as a driven variable due to the conservation of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal G}$.\cite{Tuckerman2001} Moreover, from the $8N$ individual equations implied in Eqs.~\ref{eq:nhc_q} and \ref{eq:nhc_pi}, $2N$ must be eliminated due to the constraints involving $\vt q_i$ and $\vt \pi_i$ for all $i$. By taking all these facts into account and applying the analysis of Ref.~\onlinecite{Tuckerman2001}, we can deduce that the metric determinant factor of the effective phase space is $\sqrt{g} = e^{(6N-2) \eta_1 + \sum_{j=2}^M \eta_j}$ and that the correct canonical distribution is attained if $L = 6N$.

\subsection{Integration of the Canonical Equations of Motion}

As in the Hamiltonian case, the evolution of a phase-space function $f(\vt r, \vt p, \vt q, \vt \pi, \vt \eta,{\vt p}_\eta)$ is given by the relation $f(t) = e^{t i\!L}f_0$, but now in the context of the generalized Liouville theorem.\cite{Tuckerman_1999, Tuckerman2001} This implies that we can employ the Trotter-Suzuki splitting to devise a strategy for integrating the equations of motion. First, we consider the usual separation of the non-Hamiltonian components of the equations of motion from the Hamiltonian components. In this case, the generalized Liouville operator can be written as $i\!L = i\!L_\text{NHC} + i\!L_\text{NVE}$, where $i\!L_\text{NVE}$ is defined as in Eq.~\ref{eq:full_operator}. Retaining the NVE factorization scheme defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_NVE}, we write the full operator as\cite{Martyna1996}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:trotter_splitting_NHC}
e^{\Delta t i\!L} = e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b} e^{\Delta t i\!L_r} e^{\Delta t i\!L_t}  e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}}.
\end{equation}

It follows from Eq.~\ref{eq:nhc_system} that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:iL_NHC}
\begin{split}
i\!L_\text{NHC} &= -\alpha_1 \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \tr{\vt p}_i \diff{}{\vt p_i} + \tr{\vt \pi}_i \diff{}{\vt \pi_i}\right) + \\
&+ \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_j \diff{}{\eta_j} + \sum_{j=1}^M \left[ (G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}) \diff{}{p_{\eta_j}} \right].
\end{split}
\end{equation}

If the last summation was absent from the equation above, then the action of the propagator $e^{t i\!L_\text{NHC}}$ would be the solution of the equations $\dot{\vt p}_i = -\alpha_1 \vt p_i$ and $\dot{\vt \pi}_i = -\alpha_1 \vt \pi_i$ for all $i \in [1,N]$ and $\dot{\eta}_j = \alpha_j$ for all $j \in [1,M]$, with all other variables remaining constant at their initial values. This system of equations can be solved analytically, which results in
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&\vt p_i(t) = \vt p_i^0 e^{-\alpha_1 t}, \\
&\vt \pi_i(t) = \vt \pi_i^0 e^{-\alpha_1 t}, \quad \text{and}\\
&\eta_j(t) = \eta_j^0 + \alpha_j t. \label{eq:solution_eta}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Otherwise, if a single term $(G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}) \partial/\partial p_{\eta_j}$ was the only term present in Eq.~\ref{eq:iL_NHC}, then $e^{t i\!L_\text{NHC}}$ would behave according to the equation $\dot{p}_{\eta_j} = G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}$, with all variables other than $p_{\eta_j}$ kept unchanged. The analytical solution of this single equation is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:solution_p_eta}
\begin{split}
&p_{\eta_j}(t) = p_{\eta_j}^0 + \left( G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}^0 \right) \phi\left(\alpha_{j+1} t\right) t, \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(x) = (1-e^{-x})/x$. We might note that, in order to avoid numerical issues with $x \rightarrow 0$, we evaluate $\phi(x)$ as $\sum_{n=0}^3 {(-1)^n x^n}/{(n+1)!}$ whenever $|x| \leq 10^{-4}$. The solution above is equivalent to that found in Ref.~\onlinecite{Martyna1996}.

Considering the analytical solutions described above, it is possible to split the NHC operator into $2M+1$ factors by applying the Trotter-Suzuki formula in a recursive way. The splitting we employ here, noting that the product signs run in reverse orders, is
\begin{align*}
e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}} = &\prod_{j=M}^1 \exp \left[ \frac{\Delta t}{4} (G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}) \diff{}{p_{\eta_j}} \right] \\
\times \exp \Bigg[ -\frac{\Delta t}{2} &\alpha_1 \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\tr{\vt p}_i \diff{}{\vt p_i} + \tr{\vt \pi}_i \diff{}{\vt \pi_i}\right) + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_j \diff{}{\eta_j} \Bigg] \\
\times &\prod_{j=1}^M \exp \left[\frac{\Delta t}{4} (G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j}) \diff{}{p_{\eta_j}} \right].\\
\end{align*}

It is worth noting that an analytical solution can also be derived for the system of equations $\dot{\vt p}_i = {\vt F}_i - \alpha_1 \vt p_i$ and $\dot{\vt \pi}_i = 2 \mt C_i \vt \tau_i - \alpha_1 \vt \pi_i$ for all $i \in [1,N]$ if all other variables are constant. These equations are equivalent in form to the one solved above, so that their solutions are
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:solution_momenta}
\begin{align}
&{\vt p}_i(t) = {\vt p}_i^0 + \left({\vt F}_i - \alpha_1 {\vt p}_i^0 \right) \phi\left(\alpha_1 t \right) t \quad \text{and} \label{eq:solution_p} \\
&{\vt \pi}_i(t) = {\vt \pi}_i^0 + \left(2 \tr{\vt \tau}_i \tr{\mt C}_i - \alpha_1 {\vt \pi}_i^0 \right) \phi\left(\alpha_1 t \right) t. \label{eq:solution_pi}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

By evaluating these functions simultaneously for all $i$, we accomplish the effect of a propagator $e^{t i\!L_b^\ast}$, where $i\!L_b^\ast$ is the Liouville operator given by
\[
i\!L_b^\ast = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \left( \tr{\vt F}_i - \alpha_1 \tr{\vt p}_i \right) \diff{}{\vt p_i} + \left(2 \tr{\vt \tau}_i \tr{\mt C}_i - \alpha_1 \tr{\vt \pi}_i \right) \diff{}{\vt \pi_i} \right].
\]

This is a kind of boost that already incorporates the influence of the thermostat chain. One of the aims of this paper is to compare the performance of the integrator given by Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_NHC} to that obtained when the solution in Eq.~\ref{eq:solution_momenta} is considered. For that, we also define a modified Nos\'e-Hoover chain propagator $e^{i\!L^\ast_\text{NHC}}$, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}^\ast } = &\prod_{j=M}^1 \exp\left[\frac{\Delta t}{4} \left( G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j} \right) \diff{}{p_{\eta_j}}\right] \\
\times &\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{2} \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_j \diff{}{\eta_j}\right) \\
\times &\prod_{j=1}^M \exp\left[\frac{\Delta t}{4} \left( G_j - \alpha_{j+1} p_{\eta_j} \right) \diff{}{p_{\eta_j}}\right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Of course, Eqs.~\ref{eq:solution_eta} and \ref{eq:solution_p_eta} are the ones used to evaluate the propagators above. Finally, the complete scheme is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:modified_splitting}
\begin{split}
e^{\Delta t i\!L} = e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}^\ast} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b^\ast} e^{\Delta t i\!L_r} e^{\Delta t i\!L_t}  e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_b^\ast} e^{\frac{\Delta t}{2} i\!L_\text{NHC}^\ast}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In the microcanonical case, each term of the Liouville operator is Hamiltonian and, therefore, each factor of the splitting is a symplectic propagator. As a consequence, the whole propagator preserves the phase-space volume. Recall that the inverse statement is not necessarily true. It is now widely recognized that the symplectic property is important for numerical stability,\cite{Skeel1997} although it is restricted to Hamiltonian systems. For non-Hamiltonian equations of motion, the phase space volume is no longer conserved. Nevertheless, there exists an invariant measure on the phase space, and for the system in Eq.~\ref{eq:nhc_system}, it is given by
\begin{align*}
\bar{\omega} = e^{6N \eta_1 + \sum_{j=2}^M \eta_j} \wedge {\vt r} \wedge {\vt p} \wedge {\vt q} \wedge {\vt \pi} \wedge {\vt \eta} \wedge {\vt p_\eta}
\end{align*}

In this sense, Ezra \cite{Ezra2006} has introduced a systematic method for deriving accurate integrators which are both time-reversible and measure-preserving. In his work, he also pointed out that the use of an accurate measure-preserving integrator does not necessarily lead to trajectories that are more ergodic. It can be shown that many of the individual operators in both Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_NHC} and Eq.~\ref{eq:modified_splitting} do not preserve the invariant measure. Nevertheless, as will be shown in the forthcoming section, those numerical schemes successfully achieve the specified temperature and an acceptable long-term conservation of the extended energy $H$. Note that the term that premultiplies the extended phase-space volume in the invariant-measure above is a function of $\vt \eta$. Given that the time evolution of the physical variables and the thermostat momenta does not depend on $\vt \eta$, we might conclude that, in this case, the measure-preserving condition for every individual operator can actually be relaxed.

\subsection{Pressure of a System of Rigid Bodies}
\label{sec:pressure}

The pressure of a system with constant $NVT$, for which $\sum_{i=1}^N{\vt F}_i = 0$, is calculated by\cite{Louwerse2006, Tuckerman2001}
\[
P = \frac{(N-1) k_B T}{V} - \left\langle \frac{dU}{dV} \right\rangle.
\]

For simplicity, we consider a system of rigid bodies under periodic boundary conditions whose potential energy function is pairwise additive with respect to individual atoms, so that the approach of Louwerse and Baerends\cite{Louwerse2006} can be applied (otherwise, one can employ the approach of Thompson \textit{et al.}\cite{Thompson2009}) Assuming the minimum image convention, the potential energy per unit box is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_pairwise_pbc}
U({\vt r}, {\vt q}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} \upsilon(r_{ijkl}),
\end{equation}
where $\upsilon(r)$ is a pair interaction potential and $r_{ijkl}$ is the distance between the $l$-th atom of body $j$ and the nearest image of the $k$-th atom of body $i$. Such distance is the norm of a vector ${\vt r}_{ijkl} = \hat{\vt r}_{ij} + {\mt A}({\vt q}_i){{\vt d}_k}_i - {\mt A}({\vt q}_j){{\vt d}_l}_k$, where $\hat{\vt r}_{ij}$ points from the center of mass of body $j$ to that of the body which contains the mentioned atom image. We note that $U$ does not depend explicitly on $V$, which makes ${\partial U}/{\partial V} = 0$. In addition, we consider that an isotropic change in volume would only displace the centers of mass of the bodies, without any rotation. This makes\cite{Louwerse2006, Tuckerman2010}
\[
\frac{\partial \hat{\vt r}_{ij}}{\partial V} = \frac{\tr{\hat{\vt r}}_{ij}}{3V} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial {\vt q}_i}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial {\vt q}_j}{\partial V} = 0.
\]

Therefore, applying the chain rule to Eq.~\ref{eq:U_pairwise_pbc} yields
\[
\frac{dU}{dV} = \frac{1}{3V} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} \tr{\hat{\vt r}}_{ij} \upsilon^\prime(r_{ijkl})\diff{r_{ijkl}}{\vt r_{ijkl}},
\]
where $\upsilon^\prime(r) = \partial \upsilon/\partial r$.

















: the one whose $k$-th particle is nearest to the $l$-th particle of body $j$.



$\vt r_{ijkl} = \hat{\vt r}_{ij} + {\vt \delta_k}_i - {\vt \delta_l}_j$

${\vt \delta_k}_i$ and ${\vt \delta_l}_j$ respectively depend on $\vt q_i$ and $\vt q_j$ as defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:kinematics}, while $\hat{\vt r}_{ij}$ is the vector pointing from the center of mass of body $j$ to that of an image of body $i$: the one whose $k$-th particle is nearest to the $l$-th particle of body $j$.

defi

atom $jl$ (the $l$-th particle of body $j$) to the nearest image of atom $ik$ (the $k$-th particle of body $i$). If $\hat{\vt r}_{ij}$ is the vector pointing from the center of mass of body $j$ to the center of mass of the body $i$ that co

\begin{equation}
\diff{U}{V} = \frac{1}{3V} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} \upsilon(\|\vt r_{ijkl}\|),
\end{equation}


where ${\vt r}_{ijkl} = {\vt r}_{ij} + {\mt A}({\vt q}_i){{\vt d}_i}_k - {\mt A}({\vt q}_j){{\vt d}_j}_l$

where ${\vt r}_{ij} = {\vt r}_i - {\vt r}_j$ is the vector pointing from the center of mass of body $j$ to that of body $i$. Given that $U$ does not depend explicitly on $V$ and that the bodies would neither deform nor rotate by an isotropic change in volume, we have that $\partial {\vt q}_i / \partial L = \partial {\vt q}_j / \partial L = 0$ and $\partial {\vt r}_{ij}/\partial V = \tr{\vt r}_{ij}/(3V)$.\cite{Louwerse2006} Therefore,
\[
\diff{U}{V} = \frac{1}{6V} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^{\infty} \tr{\vt r}_{ij} \diff{u}{{\vt r}_{ij}}.
\]

Now let us define ${\vt r}_{ijkl}$ as the vector pointing from the $k$-th atom of body $i$ to the $l$-th atom of body $j$, that is, ${\vt r}_{ijkl} = {\vt r}_{ij} + {\mt A}({\vt q}_i){{\vt d}_i}_k - {\mt A}({\vt q}_j){{\vt d}_j}_l$. For a pair potential $\upsilon(r)$, whose dependence on the atom identities is omitted for simplicity, we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_rigid_body_pair}
u({\vt r}_{ij},{\vt q}_i,{\vt q}_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} \upsilon \left( \|{\vt r}_{ijkl}\| \right).
\end{equation}
where $r_{ijkl} = \|{\vt r}_{ijkl}\|$. Then, by the chain rule,
\[
\diff{u}{{\vt r}_{ij}} = \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} \diff{\vt r_{ijkl}}{\vt r_{ij}} \diff{\upsilon}{\vt r_{ijkl}}.
\]

Inside the double summation above, the first derivative is the identity matrix and the second one is the $-{\vt F}_{ijkl}$, with this force being the action of the $l$-th particle of body $j$ over the $k$-th particle of body $i$. Therefore, the equation above results in $-\vt F_{ij}$, with this force being the resultant action of body $j$ over body $i$. Finally, we conclude that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pressure}
P = \frac{(N-1) k_B T}{V} - \frac{1}{6V} \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^{\infty} {\vt r}_{ij} \cdot {\vt F}_{ij} \right\rangle.
\end{equation}

With minimum image convention:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pressure_minimum_image}
P = \frac{(N-1) k_B T}{V} - \frac{1}{3V} \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^N {\vt r}_{ij}^\ast \cdot {\vt F}_{ij}^\ast \right\rangle.
\end{equation}

This expression resembles the equation normally used to compute pressure in atomic systems, except that the internal virial is defined in terms of resultant interaction forces between rigid body pairs. Thus, an atom located outside the central box will contribute to this virial if it belongs to a body whose center lies in the box, and vice-versa.

\textbf{To do}: Write about minimum image convention considering rigid bodies instead of atoms and about how to compute the internal virial directly using the equation below:
\[
W = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{j=i+1}^{\infty} \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} {\vt f}_{ijkl} \cdot {\vt r}_{ij}.
\]

\[
W = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} {\vt f}_{ijkl} \cdot \left[ {\vt r}_{ijkl} - {\mt A}({\vt q}_i){{\vt d}_i}_k + {\mt A}({\vt q}_j){{\vt d}_j}_l \right].
\]

\[
\begin{split}
W = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} {\vt f}_{ijkl} \cdot {\vt r}_{ijkl} \\
- \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \left( \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} {\vt f}_{ijkl} \right) \cdot {\mt A}({\vt q}_i){{\vt d}_i}_k \\
+ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N \sum_{k=1}^{{n_p}_i} \sum_{l=1}^{{n_p}_j} {\vt f}_{ijkl} \cdot {\mt A}({\vt q}_j){{\vt d}_j}_l.
\end{split}
\]

\section{Numerical Results}

In this section, we analyze some performance aspects of the integration schemes when applied to a molecular system in the liquid state. Given its practical importance, we simulated 356 TIP3P\cite{Price2004} water molecules at a density of 999.56 $kg/m^3$. The intermolecular interactions were truncated at 9 {\AA}. The shifted-force (SF) method\cite{Allen1989,Toxvaerd_2011} was used to treat both the coulombic and the 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions.

\subsection{Numerical Stability}
\label{sec:performance}

In order to evaluate the stability of the numerical solvers, we use a measure given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:performance}
D E =  \frac{1}{N_{steps}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{steps}} \left| \frac{E_{t_k} - E_0}{E_0} \right|,
\end{equation}
from which it is possible to calculate the average deviation of the conserved quantity, i.e. total energy, from its initial value $E_0$ after a certain number of time steps $N_{steps}$. Both the instantaneous fluctuations of energy, given by the term inside the summation, and the long-time conservation of energy, $D E$, are monitored.  

Recall that the method introduced here for the NVE dynamics is a mathematical reformulation of the NO$\rule{0.25cm}{0.15mm}$SQUISH algorithm introduced by Miller~\textit{et al.}\cite{Miller2002}, so the trajectories for both methods must coincide out of round-off errors. In Fig.~\ref{fig:miller1fs} we plot the instantaneous fluctuations of energy with $n_{ys} = 1 $ and a time step of 1 fs, where it can be seen that, in fact, the fluctuations for both methods are of similar magnitude. The simulation with the NO$\rule{0.25cm}{0.15mm}$SQUISH algorithm was conducted using the LAMMPS\cite{Plimpton1995} software package. For the purpose of comparison we applied the LJ model without shifting the forces, as it is not implemented in LAMMPS.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\label{fig:miller1fs}
\end{figure}

In Table~\ref{table:nve} we compare the energy drift when using $n_{ys} = 1$ and $n_{ys} = 7$ in the rotational operator, Eq.~\ref{eq:ys_rot}. As expected, for a small time step of 1 fs, that further factorization is worthless. As the time step is increased, more accurate trajectories are achieved with $n_{ys} = 7 $. Nevertheless, the improvement is only marginal and all trajectories are stables exhibiting a small long-time energy drift. Thus, we proceed to analyze the NVT dynamics considering $n_{ys} = 1$.

It is not the purpose of this work to achieve an optimal factorization of the NVT schemes, but rather to show that a unique chain thermostat, while providing the ``proper'' sampling of the NVT ensemble, is capable of maintaining the average temperature at its specified value. In order to use a constant value for the smaller time step in the NHC and NHC* operators $(\Delta t/4)$, we factorized those operators analogously to the scheme given by Eq.~\ref{eq:splitting_rot}. Recalling that in the NVT dynamics the conserved quantity is the extended energy $\mathcal{H}^\prime$, in Table~\ref{table:denvt} we show the results of Eq.~\ref{eq:performance} as well as the average temperatures obtained in each case. It can be seen that both integrators, represented by the Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_NHC} and Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_*}, systematically achieve the specified temperature, regardless of the time step size. In addition, the energy drift is, at its worst, around $1 \%$.

\subsection{Partition of Energy}
\label{sec:energypartition}

Checking the consistency between the equipartition of energy and the simulated energies serves as another approach for investigating the precision of a simulation. In fact, as stated by Eastwood~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Eastwood_2010}, it has been useful to improve methodologies related to the calculation of electrostatic\cite{Levitt_1988,Guenot_1992,Arnold_1994} and dispersive\cite{Sagui_1999} interactions, as well as to detect errors in thermostats\cite{Harvey_1998,Mor_2008} and barostats\cite{Feller_1995}. The truncation error associated to the numerical schemes is a potential source of error, and is the focus of the work of Eastwood~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Eastwood_2010}, which investigates a solvated protein and a temperature difference of approximately 5.5 $K$ is observed between the protein and the solvent using a time step of 2 fs.

In this paper, we analyze the partition of energy between the translational and rotational DOF, which are related to the temperature by the equipartition theorem as follows
\begin{align}
\label{eq:tras_equipartition}
2 \langle E_{kin}^{trans} \rangle = (3N - 3) k_b T
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\label{eq:rot_equipartition}
2 \langle E_{kin}^{rot} \rangle = 3N k_b T
\end{align} 
In these equations, $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. In NVE MD simulations, conservation of total linear momentum, $ \boldsymbol{P}= cte $, results in the loss of three translational DOF : $ 3N-3 $. For a cubic box with PBC there is no rotational symmetry ~\cite{Frenkel_2013,Kuzkin_2014}, with which the total angular momentum is not conserved, giving a number of rotational DOF of $3N$.  We calculate the average energy per DOF $ \langle E_{cin} \rangle_{DOF} = \langle E_{cin} \rangle /N_{DOF}$ and then we calculate both the translational and rotational energies from equipartition as follows

\begin{equation}
\langle E_{kin}^{trans}\rangle =  \langle E_{kin} \rangle_{DOF} \, (3N-3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\langle E_{kin}^{rot} \rangle =  \langle E_{kin} \rangle_{DOF} \, (3N)
\end{equation}


In the tables below we report the translational and rotational energies using Eqs.~\ref{eq:tras_equipartition} and~\ref{eq:rot_equipartition}, together with those obtained in the NVE simulations. In this case, we simulated 903 molecules of liquid water in order to examine the behavior for a cutoff distance of $13$ {\AA}, which is a more conservative criterion as it provides better numerical stability. In Table~\ref{table:water_partition_LJ-SF} we observe that for a small time step of 0.5 fs the energies are in good correspondence, which is lost when the time step is increased. This result is confirmed also in Table~\ref{table:water_partition_13A_LJ-SF} for the cutoff distance of 13 {\AA}. This allows us to prove the influence of the truncation error on in this effect, in accordance with what Eastwood~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Eastwood_2010} point out. For significant deviations, the main implication is that Eqs.~\ref{eq:tras_equipartition} and~\ref{eq:rot_equipartition} are no longer suitable for the temperature calculation, which becomes an undefined property. In the aforementioned paper, the authors introduce an alternative approach for calculating the temperature which is based on the generalized equipartition theorem applied to the Shadow Hamiltonian, which will be investigated in future work.

\subsection{Sampling Validation}
\label{sec:samplingvalidation}
In this subsection we present the results from a simple method that serves for checking the consistency between the sampled energy distributions and the theoretical ones. The procedure, introduced and implemented by Shirts ~\cite{Shirts2013}, relies on a quantitative statistical analysis of fitting and it is possible to perform linear and nonlinear fitting or a maximum likelihood approach too. This last approach does not involve any binning of the energies, hence no discretization error is present. We report the results corresponding to that method, and since it is instructive to have a graphical insight, we also show some figures of the linear fitting.

Recall that in the NVT ensemble the probability of observing an energy E is given by
\[
P(E/\beta) = Q(\beta)^{-1}\Omega(E)\exp\left(-\beta E\right),
\]
where $ \beta $ is the Boltzmann's constant, $ \Omega(E) $ is the density of states which does not depend on $ \beta $ , and $ Q(\beta) $  is the canonical partition function, linked to the Helmholtz Free Energy $ (A) $ by $A = -\beta^{-1}\ln(Q)$. 

Taking the ratio of the probability distributions at different temperatures, the unknown density of states cancels out and we get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:probability_ratio}
\frac{P(E/\beta_2)}{P(E/\beta_1)} = exp\left[(\beta_2 A_2 - \beta_1 A_1) - (\beta_2 - \beta_1)E\right].
\end{equation}
Taking the logarithm of Eq.~\ref{eq:probability_ratio}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ln_probability_ratio}
ln\frac{P(E/\beta_2)}{P(E/\beta_1)} = \left(\beta_2 A_2 - \beta_1 A_1\right) - \left(\beta_2 - \beta_1\right)E.
\end{equation}

The Eq.~\ref{eq:ln_probability_ratio} is the basis for the statistical analysis in the ensemble validation, which determines how many standard deviations the calculated slope is from the specified one,  $ \beta_2 - \beta_1 $. Note that it is independent of the unknown free energies. For a guidance on how to choose the temperature gap the reader is referred to the aforementioned paper. Given that the potential and kinetic energies are separable, the analysis can be made separately as follows

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:probability_ratio_pot}
\frac{P_{pot}(E/\beta_2)}{P_{pot}(E/\beta_1)} = \frac{Q_{pot}(\beta_1)}{Q_{pot}(\beta_2)}  exp\left[(-\beta_2 - \beta_1)E_{pot}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:probability_ratio_kin}
\frac{P_{kin}(E/\beta_2)}{P_{kin}(E/\beta_1)} = \frac{Q_{kin}(\beta_1)}{Q_{kin}(\beta_2)}  exp\left[(-\beta_2 - \beta_1)E_{kin}\right]
\end{equation}
Furthermore,  it is possible to examine the consistency between the sampled kinetic energy and the corresponding Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is given by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mb}
P(E_{cin}) = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{N_{DOF}\pi}} \, exp \left[-\frac{\left(\beta E_{kin} - \frac{N_{DOF}}{2}\right)^2}{N_{DOF}} \right],
\end{equation}
where $N_{DOF}$ is the number of degrees of freedom. This last equations is a normal distribution characterized by an average of $ \langle E_{kin} \rangle = (N_{DOF}/2\beta) $ and variance $\sigma^2 = N_{DOF}/2\beta^2$, valid when equipartition of energy is satisfied.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:checkensemble} we show the result from the linear regression analysis for the potential energies sampled using Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_NHC}. In figure legends we show the averages temperatures simulated. It can be seen that the mentioned algorithm generates a distribution consistent with the canonical ensemble, and that is also true for the kinetic energies. Likewise, in Fig.~\ref{fig:mbdistribution} we observe a good correspondence between the kinetic energy distribution at $T= 304.99 K$ and the corresponding Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution We arrive at the same conclusions for the approach given by Eq.~\ref{eq:trotter_splitting_*}.

\label{fig:mbdistribution}
\end{center}

Finally, in Table~\ref{table:ensemblevalidation} we present the results of the maximum likelihood approach applied for both NVT integration schemes. It can be seen that the deviations from the true slope, $\Delta T= 8.970 K $, are less than $1\sigma$. This means that effectively, the sampled values do not deviate from the correct distribution to a statistically noticeable level.

\section{\label{sec:quat_from_A}Obtaining the quaternion components from a rotation matrix}

The method described here was introduced by Shepperd.\cite{Shepperd1978} As one can observe in Eq.~\ref{eq:A_from_q}, the three main diagonal components of $\mt A$ and the fact that $\lVert \vt q \lVert^2 = 1$ provide a linear system for the squares of the quaternion components whose solution is
\begin{align*}
4 q_0^2 &= 1 + tr(\mt A) \\
4 q_k^2 &= 1 + A_{k,k} - tr(\mt A)
\end{align*}
where $k = 1,2,3$ and $tr(\mt A)$ is the trace of matrix $\mt A$. Since both $\vt q$ and $- \vt q$ correspond to the same rotation matrix, the sign the largest component\cite{Shepperd1978} can be made positive and the others can be obtained from the off-diagonal entries of $\mt A$, which give
\begin{align*}
4 q_0 q_1 &= A_{2,3} - A_{3,2} \\
4 q_0 q_2 &= A_{3,1} - A_{1,3} \\
4 q_0 q_3 &= A_{1,2} - A_{2,1} \\
4 q_k q_l &= A_{k,l} + A_{l,k} \\
\end{align*}
where $k,l = 1,2,3$ with $k \neq l$.

\section{\label{sec:auxiliary_math}Algebraic relations involving unit quaternions}

Let us analyze the matrix $\mt B$ defined as in Eq.~\ref{eq:def_B_and_C}. Note that $\tr{\mt B}\vt q = \vt 0$, where $\vt 0$ is a null vector.\cite{Haug1989, Shuster1993, Dichmann1999} This means that all columns of $\mt B$ are orthogonal to $\vt q$. As these columns have unit norm and are also orthogonal to each other, they form an orthonormal basis for the hyperplane orthogonal to $\mt q$, which is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$. Therefore, the general operation $\vt y = \mt B \vt x$ transforms a vector $\vt x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ into a quaternion $\vt y \in \mathbb{R}^4$, but restricted to the mentioned hyperplane. Other two identities that hold for $\mt B$ are\citep{Haug1989}
\begin{align*}
\tr{\mt B}\mt B &= \lVert \vt q \lVert ^2{\mt 1}_3 \text{ and} \\
\mt B\tr{\mt B} &= \lVert \vt q \lVert ^2{\mt 1}_4 - {\vt q}\tr{\vt q}.
\end{align*}

If $\lVert \vt q \lVert^2 = 1$, then the operation $\vt y = \mt B \vt x$ can always be reverted by $\tr{\mt B}$. This is not true for a general operation in the opposite direction, $\vt x = \tr{\mt B} \vt y$. Besides unit norm, it is necessary that $\tr{\vt q}\vt y = 0$ (i.e. orthogonality of $\vt y$ and $\vt q$) for the operation to be reversible by $\mt B$. In fact, the composite transformation $\mt B\tr{\mt B}$ corresponds to a projection into the hyperplane orthogonal to $\vt q$.\cite{Dichmann1999}

All the conclusions drawn thus far for matrix $\mt B$ are equally valid for matrix $\mt C$.

As the columns of $\mt B$ are permutations of the Euler parameters, one can write $\mt B = [\begin{array}{ccc}{\mt B}_1{\vt q} & {\mt B}_2{\vt q} & {\mt B}_3{\vt q}\end{array}]$, where $\mt B_1$, $\mt B_2$, and $\mt B_3$ are permutation matrices given by
\[
{\mt B}_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 &  1 \\
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right], \;
{\mt B}_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  1 &  0 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right],
\]\[
\text{and }{\mt B}_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
 0 &  0 &  1 &  0 \\
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right].
\]

All these permutation matrices are skew-symmetric (i.e. $\tr{\mt B_k} = -\mt B_k$) and also satisfy the relations\cite{Dichmann1999}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BB_products}
\begin{aligned}
\tr{\mt B_1}{\mt B_1} &= \tr{\mt B_2}{\mt B_2} = \tr{\mt B_3}{\mt B_3} = \mt 1_3 \\
\tr{\mt B_1}{\mt B_2} &= -\tr{\mt B_2}{\mt B_1} = -\tr{\mt B_3} \\
\tr{\mt B_2}{\mt B_3} &= -\tr{\mt B_3}{\mt B_2} = -\tr{\mt B_1} \\
\tr{\mt B_3}{\mt B_1} &= -\tr{\mt B_1}{\mt B_3} = -\tr{\mt B_2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The product of $\mt B$ with an arbitrary vector $\vt x$ results in
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:product_B_vector}
\mt B \vt x = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \mt B_1 \vt q & \mt B_2 \vt q & \mt B_3 \vt q \end{array}\right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array} \right] = \sum_{k=1}^3 x_k {\mt B}_k \vt q.
\end{equation}

Similarly, the product of $\tr{\mt B}$ with an arbitrary quaternion $\vt y$ results in
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vector_entries}
\tr{\mt B}\vt y =
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_1 \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_2 \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_3 \\
\end{array}\right]\vt y = 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_1\vt y \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_2\vt y \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_3\vt y \\
\end{array}\right] = 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt y}{\mt B}_1\vt q \\
\tr{\vt y}{\mt B}_2\vt q \\
\tr{\vt y}{\mt B}_3\vt q \\
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}

Let us now consider the product $\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt B}$, where $\dot{\mt B}$ is the time derivative of $\mt B$. Because the permutation matrices are constant, we can express $\dot{\mt B} = [\begin{array}{ccc}{\mt B}_1\dot{\vt q} & {\mt B}_2\dot{\vt q} & {\mt B}_3\dot{\vt q}\end{array}]$. By carrying out the multiplication and applying the relations of Eq.~\ref{eq:BB_products}, we observe that
\[
\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt B} = \left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_3}\dot{\vt q} & \tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_2}\dot{\vt q} \\
\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_3}\dot{\vt q} & 0 & -\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_1}\dot{\vt q} \\
-\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_2}\dot{\vt q} & \tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt B_1}\dot{\vt q}  & 0
\end{array}
\right],
\]
where the diagonal entries are zero as a consequence of the orthogonality between $\vt q$ and $\dot{\vt q}$. By contrasting this result with Eq.~\ref{eq:operator_S}, we draw the conclusion that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relation_B_qdot}
\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt B} = {\mt S}\left( \tr{\mt B}\dot{\vt q} \right).
\end{equation}

Matrix $\mt C$ and its time-derivative $\dot{\mt C}$ can also be expressed as $[\begin{array}{ccc}{\mt C}_1{\vt q} & {\mt C}_2{\vt q} & {\mt C}_3{\vt q}\end{array}]$ and $[\begin{array}{ccc}{\mt C}_1\dot{\vt q} & {\mt C}_2\dot{\vt q} & {\mt C}_3\dot{\vt q}\end{array}]$, respectively, where $\mt C_1$, $\mt C_2$, and $\mt C_3$ are
\[
{\mt C}_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
 0 &  0 &  1 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right], \;
{\mt C}_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 &  1 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right],
\]\[
\text{and }{\mt C}_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
 0 &  1 &  0 &  0 \\
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
\end{array} \right].
\]

A special connection between the permutation matrices for $\mt B$ and $\mt C$ is the fact that $\tr{\mt B_i}{\mt C_j}$ is symmetric for any combination of $i$ and $j$. Thus, each entry of $\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt C}$ is
\begin{align*}
\{\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt C}\}_{ij} &= \tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt B}_i{\mt C}_j\dot{\vt q} = \tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_j{\mt B}_i\dot{\vt q} = \{\tr{\mt C}\dot{\mt B}\}_{ji} = \\
&= \{\tr{\dot{\mt B}}\mt C\}_{ij}.
\end{align*}

This means that $\tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt C} = \tr{\dot{\mt B}}{\mt C}$. Proceeding further, we observe that
\begin{align*}
\mt A \tr{\dot{\mt A}} &= \tr{\mt B}\mt C \tr{(\tr{{\mt B}}\dot{\mt C} + \tr{\dot{\mt B}}{\mt C})} = \tr{\mt B}\mt C \tr{(2 \tr{\dot{\mt B}}{\mt C})} = \\
&= 2 \tr{\mt B}\dot{\mt B},
\end{align*}
where we have applied the relations $\mt C \tr{\mt C} = \mt 1_4 - \vt q\tr{\vt q}$ and $\tr{\vt B}\vt q = \vt 0$. Finally, resorting to Eqs.~\ref{eq:relation_A_omega} and \ref{eq:relation_B_qdot}, the result above converts to
\begin{equation}
\vt \omega = 2\tr{\mt B}\dot{\vt q}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:operator_S}
\mt S(\vt x) = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
0   & -x_3 &  x_2 \\
x_3 &  0   & -x_1 \\
-x_2 &  x_1 &  0
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}

The operator  $\mt S(\cdot)$ is able to represent the cross-product of two vectors $\vt x$ and $\vt y$ as a matrix-vector product, since $\vt x \times \vt y = \mt S(\vt x)\vt y$. This property is explored in the Appendix.

Demonstration of Euler equation:

\begin{align*}
\diff{(\tr{\mt B}\vt \pi)}{t} &= \tr{\dot{\mt B}}\vt \pi + \tr{\mt B}\dot{\vt \pi} = \\
&=\tr{\dot{\mt B}}{\mt B}\tr{\mt B}{\vt \pi}  + \dfrac{1}{2} \tr{\mt B}\mt \Omega \vt \omega + 2 \tr{\mt B}\mt C \vt \tau = \\
&= -\frac{1}{2}{\mt S}(\vt \omega)\tr{\mt B}{\vt \pi} + \dfrac{1}{2} {\mt S}(\tr{\mt B}\mt \pi) \vt \omega + 2 \mt A \vt \tau = \\
&= - \vt \omega \times (\tr{\mt B}{\vt \pi}) + 2 {\vt \tau}^\prime
\end{align*}

As $\tr{\mt B}\vt \pi = 2 \mt I \vt \omega$, the result above becomes
\[
\mt I \dot{\vt \omega} + \vt \omega \times (\mt I \vt \omega) = {\vt \tau}^\prime
\]

\section{\label{sec:Diff_Rules}Differentiation rules with vectors}

Along the paper, the differentiation of scalar functions with respect to vectors are done directly using the following rules:
\[
\diff{(\tr{\vt x}\vt a)}{\vt x} = \diff{(\tr{\vt a}\vt x)}{\vt x} = \vt a
\]
and
\[
\diff{(\tr{\vt x}\mt A \vt x)}{\vt x} = 2 \mt A \vt x,
\]
where $\vt a$ is vector and $\mt A$ is a matrix, both independent of $\vt x$.

\section{\label{sec:Diff_PotEng}Potential energy differentiation}

Care must be taken when differentiating the potential energy $U$ with respect to $\vt q$ because the Euler parameters are not all independent. Schay demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{Schay1995} that, when differentiating a scalar function $f$ with respect to a vector variable $\vt x$, subject to a constraint $g(\vt x) = 0$, the derivative of $f$ with respect to $\vt x$ is given by
\[
\diff{f}{\vt x} = (\vt 1 - \vt n \tr{\vt n})\left( \diff{f}{\vt x} \right)^\ast,
\]
where $\vt n$ is the unit vector proportional to $(\partial g/\partial \vt x)^\ast$, with the asterisk denoting a differentiation performed without considering the interdependence of the entries of $\vt x$. We note that transpositions are necessary when comparing the equation above, based on the gradient convention, with that in Ref.~\cite{Schay1995}, where the Jacobian convention is used. In the  case of Euler parameters,
\[
g(\vt q) = \tr{\vt q}\vt q - 1 \; \rightarrow \; \left(\diff{g}{\vt q}\right)^\ast = 2 \vt q.
\]

Hence, the unit four-dimensional vector proportional to $(\partial g/\partial \vt x)^\ast$ is exactly $\vt q$, which means that the constrained derivative of $U$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_projection}
\diff{U}{\vt q} = (\mt 1_4 - {\vt q}\tr{\vt q})\left( \diff{U}{\vt q} \right)^\ast.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the constrained derivative is the projection of the unconstrained one in the hyperplane orthogonal to $\vt q$. Recently, Nielsen and Krenk\cite{Nielsen2012} employed a Lagrange multiplier approach to demonstrate the need of carrying out such projection. Schay\cite{Schay1995, Schay1998} discussed on the equivalence of the two approaches.

By applying the chain rule, we have
\[
\left( \diff{U}{\vt q} \right)^\ast = \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} \left( \diff{\vt R_j}{\vt q} \right)^\ast \diff{U}{\vt R_j} = - \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} \left( \diff{\vt R_j}{\vt q} \right)^\ast {\vt F_j},
\]
where $\vt F_j = -\partial U/\partial \vt R_j$ is, by definition, the force applied on particle $j$. As $\vt R_j = \vt r + \tr{\mt A}\vt d_j$,
\[
\left( \diff{\vt R_j}{\vt q} \right)^\ast = \left( \diff{(\tr{\mt A}\vt d_j)}{\vt q} \right)^\ast.
\]

For simplicity, we will drop the index $j$ for the next few lines. Remember that $\tr{\mt A}\vt d = \tr{\mt C} \mt B\vt d$ and, according to Eq.~\ref{eq:product_B_vector},
\[
\mt B \vt d = \sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k \vt q = \left( \sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k \right) \vt q.
\]

An identity equivalent to Eq.~\ref{eq:vector_entries} holds for the product of $\tr{\mt C}$ with an arbitrary quaternion, so that we can write
\[
\tr{\mt A}{\vt d} =
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_1 \mt B \vt d \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_2 \mt B \vt d \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_3 \mt B \vt d \\
\end{array}\right] = 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt C}_1 \left( \sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k \right) \vt q \\
\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt C}_2 \left( \sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k \right) \vt q \\
\tr{\vt q} \tr{\mt C}_3 \left( \sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k \right) \vt q \\
\end{array}\right].
\]

As mentioned in Appendix \ref{sec:auxiliary_math}, $\tr{\mt C}_i \mt B_j = \tr{\mt B}_j \mt C_i$ for any pair $ij$, so that all the constant matrices above between $\tr{\vt q}$ and $\vt q$ are constant and symmetric, which facilitates differentiation. After carrying it out and replacing back $(\sum_{k=1}^3 d_k \mt B_k) \vt q$ by $\mt B \vt d$, we have
\[
\left( \diff{\vt R}{\vt q} \right)^\ast = 2 \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\tr{\mt C}_1 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\mt C}_2 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\mt C}_3 \mt B \vt d
\end{array}\right]
\]

Considering that we deal exclusively with unit quaternions $\vt q$, so that $\mt C \tr{\mt C} = \mt 1_4 - \vt q \tr{\vt q}$ can be substituted in Eq.~\ref{eq:diff_projection}, it is useful to evaluate the product
\[
\tr{\mt C} \left( \diff{\vt R}{\vt q} \right)^\ast = 2 \left[\begin{array}{c}
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C_1} \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C_2} \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C_3}
\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\tr{\mt C}_1 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\mt C}_2 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\mt C}_3 \mt B \vt d
\end{array}\right]
\]

The permutation matrices $\mt C_1$, $\mt C_2$, and $\mt C_3$ have the following properties:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\tr{\mt C_1}\tr{\mt C_1} &= \tr{\mt C_2}\tr{\mt C_2} = \tr{\mt C_3}\tr{\mt C_3} = -\mt 1_4 \\
\tr{\mt C_1}\tr{\mt C_2} &= -\tr{\mt C_2}\tr{\mt C_1} = -\tr{\mt C_3} \\
\tr{\mt C_2}\tr{\mt C_3} &= -\tr{\mt C_3}\tr{\mt C_2} = -\tr{\mt C_1} \\
\tr{\mt C_3}\tr{\mt C_1} &= -\tr{\mt C_1}\tr{\mt C_3} = -\tr{\mt C_2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Along with the fact that $\mt B\vt d$ and $\vt q$ are necessarily orthogonal to each other, the properties above lead to
\begin{align*}
\tr{\mt C} \left( \diff{\vt R}{\vt q} \right)^\ast &= 2 \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_3 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_2 \mt B \vt d \\
\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_3 \mt B \vt d & 0 & -\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_1 \mt B \vt d \\
-\tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_2 \mt B \vt d & \tr{\vt q}\tr{\mt C}_1 \mt B \vt d & 0
\end{array}\right] \\
&= 2 \mt S(\tr{\mt C} \mt B \vt d) = 2 \mt S(\tr{\mt A}\vt d) = 2 \mt S(\vt \delta),
\end{align*}
where $\vt \delta$ is equivalent to $\vt d$, but expressed in the space-fixed frame of reference. Finally, we obtain
\[
\diff{U}{\vt q} = - 2 \mt C \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} \mt S(\vt \delta_j) {\vt F_j}  = - 2 \mt C \sum_{j=1}^{n_p} \vt \delta_j \times {\vt F_j}.
\]
